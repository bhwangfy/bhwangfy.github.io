## About Myself
Hi, I am a Ph.D. student of the joint Ph.D. Program of USTC and Microsoft Research (Asia). I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Wei Chen](https://weichen-cas.github.io/) and Professor [Zhi-Ming Ma](http://homepage.amss.ac.cn/research/homePage/8eb59241e2e74d828fb84eec0efadba5/myHomePage.html). I also work closely with [Dr. Qi Meng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/meq/), [Dr. Huishuai Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/huzhang/), and [Prof. Ruoyu Sun](https://ruoyus.github.io/). 

## Research Interests
I am broadly interested in the linear span of optimization, generalization and representation in deep learning.


## Prepints
- [Provable Adaptivity in Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09900)
<br>**Bohan Wang**, Yushun Zhang, Huishuai Zhang, Qi Meng, Zhi-Ming Ma, Tie-Yan Liu, Wei Chen
<br>**Remark:** This is a very exciting paper on why Adam outperforms SGD from the perspective of global convergence analysis. A brief introduction (in Chinese) can be found [here](https://www.zhihu.com/question/323747423/answer/2642005682).
