## About Myself
Hi, I am a Ph.D. student of the joint Ph.D. Program of USTC and Microsoft Research (Asia). I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Wei Chen](https://weichen-cas.github.io/) and Prof. [Zhi-Ming Ma](http://homepage.amss.ac.cn/research/homePage/8eb59241e2e74d828fb84eec0efadba5/myHomePage.html). I also work closely with [Dr. Qi Meng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/meq/), [Dr. Huishuai Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/huzhang/), and [Prof. Ruoyu Sun](https://ruoyus.github.io/). 

## Research Interests
My current research interest is **optimization in deep learning**. I am eager to understand the underlying mechanism of optimizers' behavior over deep neural networks. My ultimate goal is to build effective and stable optimizers for deep learning, especially for large models. Please don't hesitate to drop an email if you are interested to collaborate!


## News
- Three papers are accepted by NeurIPS 2023! Thanks to all the collaborators!
- I will visit Prof. [Ruoyu Sun](https://ruoyus.github.io/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), starting from June 11th!
