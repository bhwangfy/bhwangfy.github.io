## About Myself
Hi, I am a Ph.D. student of the joint Ph.D. Program of USTC and Microsoft Research (Asia). I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Wei Chen](https://weichen-cas.github.io/) and Prof. [Zhi-Ming Ma](http://homepage.amss.ac.cn/research/homePage/8eb59241e2e74d828fb84eec0efadba5/myHomePage.html). I also work closely with [Dr. Qi Meng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/meq/), [Dr. Huishuai Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/huzhang/), and [Prof. Ruoyu Sun](https://ruoyus.github.io/). 

## Research Interests
I am deeply interested in the interplay between deep learning and mathematics. Specifically, my research focuses on two main areas:

- **Mathematics for Deep Learning**: I am fascinated by how humans can understand deep neural networks and, more importantly, leverage this understanding to develop better models. My particular interest lies in optimization for deep learning, which I believe is one of the most critical areas where mathematics can make a significant impact. The ultimate goal in this direction is **designing the next Adam**.

- **Deep Learning for Mathematics (AI for Math)**: The impressive capabilities of large language models as natural language chatbots naturally lead to the question of whether these models can also serve as chatbots for mathematics. I am especially interested in how we can enhance language models using formal verifiers (such as Lean 4). I am a firm believer that AI will revolutionize the way human mathematicians develop mathematics and will eventually replace human mathematicians.
